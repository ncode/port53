# Trutinha
Dns something something

#### Why?

It's very common to use more than one dns solutions depending of the size of your company or environmt. The idea of this project
is to abstract the zone file management across different dns servers. This means that you could have a few zones running on bind,
a few in nsd and have other exposed via remote backend to powerdns. But still have a single place to manage them, this should also simplify
the test across different dns servers.
